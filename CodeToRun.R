# Specify DBI connection details -----
# In this study we also use the DBI package to connect to the database
# set up the dbConnect details below (see https://dbi.r-dbi.org/articles/dbi for more details)
# you may need to install another package for this (although RPostgres is included with renv in case you are using postgres)

#                 password = password)


# Set database details -----

# your sql dialect used with the OHDSI SqlRender package
# eg postgresql, redshift, etc
# see https://ohdsi.github.io/SqlRender/articles/UsingSqlRender.html for more details
targetDialect <-"postgresql" 

# The name of the schema that contains the OMOP CDM with patient-level data
cdm_database_schema<-"public"

# The name of the schema that contains the vocabularies 
# (often this will be the same as cdm_database_schema)
vocabulary_database_schema<-"public"

# The name of the schema where results tables will be created 
results_database_schema<-"results"

# Tables to be created in your results schema for this analysis will be named using this as the stem 
# Note, any existing tables in your results schema with the same names will be overwritten
cohortTableStem<-"DementiaDusIncidence"

# Check database connections -----
# to check whether the OHDSI DatabaseConnector worked, uncomment and run the below three lines
# conn <- connect(connectionDetails)
# querySql(conn,paste0("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ", cdm_database_schema, ".person"))
# disconnect(conn)

# to check the DBI worked, uncomment and run the below line
# tbl(db, sql(paste0("SELECT * FROM ",cdm_database_schema, ".person"))) %>% tally()

# in both cases, you should have a count of people in the database printed back in the console

# Run the study ------
source(here("RunStudy.R"))

# after the study is run you should have a zip folder in your output folder to share
